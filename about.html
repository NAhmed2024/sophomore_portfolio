<h2> Another Personal Photo Gallery </h2>
    <p> I'm eventually going to add more personal, I took photos. But unfortunaly, this will have to wait because
      <br> I need to select non-privte photos and then upload them on computer, which is going to take a lot of 
      <br> time. So this is a collection of photos that still repsent me. See you soon! </p>
