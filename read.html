    <h1> Why I Love Reading </h1>
    <h2 class="point"> <em> It Gives New Perspectives </em> </h2>
    <p class="pointed"> Reading about other people lives, such as a girl stuck up in a tower or a ophaned boy who surives through therviery, gives me fresh perspective of different envoriments and mental states I woudn't know in reality. </p>
    <h2 class="pointed"> <em> It's Exciting </em> </h2>
    <p class="point"> Modern life can get so boring. Waitng in a car, a lazy afternoon with nothing to do or waiting for class to be over beacuse you finshed your assigment. Diving into an adventure book where the brave, amazing heroine must past through a dangerous river full of aligators, brings all sorts of new excitement.</p>
    <h2 class="point"> <em> Reading Helps You Learn </em> </h2>
    <p class="pointed"> There is so much you can learn by reading different types of book. A nonficiton book will tell you real information on things like tires, chocolate or Paris. A history book can enlighten you on WW2 or 9/11. A fantsy book helps spark ideas of new exciting stories, charcter and worlds. (As well asdifferent perspectives to study).
